				What are Meteora?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Meteora or “suspended in the air” is the largest rock formation in the world. The highest one reach over 600 meters above sea level. Rocks are mainly maid of sandstone and agglomerate. Name Meteora comes from Greek word “meteoros” and means “raised up” or “high in the air”. Name perfectly reflects landscape as from distance the rocks looks like they would hang in the air. Meteora is located few kilometers northwest of the town of Kalabaka, which in wider scale is located north-west of the plains of Thessaly.

			<h2>
				History of Meteora
			</h2>
			<p>
				According to many historical records, the meteors uplifted due to erosion and movement of the earth. Many rivers flowed into Lake Thessaly, carrying sediment and stones. They have accumulated over the years. After the water retreated due to the earthquake, numerous cracks and scratches appeared in the monolith hardened from the sediments that the lake had built for thousands of years. Over time, the rocks began to delaminate, erosion processes took place and eventually formed separated boulders and rock chimneys called Meteors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Uniqueness of this terrain relativity quickly start attracting all different type of mystics, hermits and, finally, monks, who saw in these unusual shapes the work of the god himself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Word “monk” come from Greek “monachos”. Monos in Greek mean – solo, one, alone, single.
			</p>
			<p>
				Etymology best explains of the hermit and monastic movement, where men was getting close to his creator by prayer and asceticism, ideally somewhere in isolation. No wonder that Meteora always drawn to itself this type of people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Standing on top of those peaks you can feel like you are suspended between earth and sky.
			</p>
			<p>
				First hermits arrived to this place in 11th century, but to beginning they habituated caves and caverns. They would stay couple of days at the time praying and meditate in total silence. In 12th century new religious community is getting formed, and habitats small temple at the bottom of rocks. In 14th century when Turks started to invade Greece, monks decidet to move to a safer place which was top of Meteora.

			<h2>
				Monasteries
			</h2>
			<p>
				First Monastery was built in 14th century. In 1356-1372 Holy Monastery of Great Meteoron was build. In oncoming decades next Monasteries was build. Each of them was located at difficult to reach rock. The only option to get to it was to climb rock wall, later stage they upgraded to thrown down ladders and ropes. The first stairs were built in 1920, when new route in rock was expressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recent decades brought more truism to place; hence all active Monasteries had built access stairs to them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1988 Meteora Monasteries was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and the Meteora-Antichassia area is part of the Natura 2000 network hosting some rare species of birds and flowers.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the peak of its prosperity, 24 Orthodox monasteries operated here. Only 6 are now active and are open to visitors. The others are either in ruins or uninhabited. If we look around carefully during the walk, we should be able to spot some of the ruins, mainly fragments of the walls. The monasteries, especially during the Turkish occupation, were places where Greek traditions were cultivated, and important treasures of Greek culture were hidden. Some of the collections (including books, paintings, letters) are on display in special rooms in the monasteries. Many of the collections were moved during World War II. The monasteries were usually male, although unlike the monasteries on Athos, there were also female monasteries to which only women were allowed.

			<h2>
				When and how much time is needed to visit. 
			</h2>
			<p>
				Most busy time of year in Meteora is between June and August, but you need to take on board it is the hottest time of year as well. Best months for visiting are April/May and September/October were temperatures usually flatulate between 15 to 22 degrees. It is worth avoiding Greek holidays and weekends, then, in addition to foreign tourists, there are also crowds of locals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Distances between Monasteries and significant, so physical condition is also needed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most optimal time to visit all monasteries is between 2-4 day bearing in mind Meteora is not only Monasteries but beautiful nature around and some interesting places in Kalambaka and Kastraki.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like The Byzantine Church of Kalambaka. Church is open every day from 8.30 till 13.00 and 15.00 till 20.00.  There is a small entrance fee of €2.00. 
			</p>

			<h2>
				Tours and walks  
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Walking – if you prepared for huge amount of activity, you could walk around all 6 Monasteries. This way of course will take much longer to visit all of them, and it will be very tiring, but views will compromise this inconvenience. You also need to be particularly careful when going up and down the rocks, as very uneven surfaces in places. There are no walking paths, you will be walking on the road, so extra carefulness is needed as sharing this space with vast number of cars on the road. Roads are very winding, can be fogy so wear reflective clothing, especially when dawn is coming.  
					Some of places worth to look out for when walking around: 
					<ul>
						<li>
							Walking from Kastraki towards St. Nicholas Anapafsas Monastery will be passing one of the caves, which people with climbing skill particularly adore. They climb inside and lave their country flags. 
						</li>
						<li>
							A little bit behind St. Nicholas Anapafsas Monastery there is walk way towards Varlaam Monastery, route is very complicated, as very uneven stone steps, but on the way we can find few caves worth looking at. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Route from Varlaam Monastery to Holy Trinity Monastery is probably the longest – nearly 4 kilometres. The road is mostly straight, although there are some more difficult parts. The walk is compensated by incredible charming views.
						</li>
					</ul>
					Few extra tips for preparing for walking activities: 
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure we have appropriate footwear for the journey, clothes and headgear </li>
						<li>Have plenty of drinking water</li>
						<li>In hotter days make regular breaks</li>
						<li>Try to start your journey before sunrise, this way you will be able to see sunrise over the rocks </li>
						<li>On route to and around Meteora there are no shops or cafes, so make sure you do take food with you.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					You can travel around in a bus. In summer season buses from Kalambaka and Kastraki travels 4 times a day, but last one from Meteora is quite early so you can’t count to see sunset over horizon.
					Need to be aware that times and routes change very often so best way is to check before travel on KTEL Trikala website <a target="blank" href="http://www.ktel-trikala.gr">www.ktel-trikala.gr</a>
					Tickets also can be bought with the driver. 
				</li>
				<li>
					If we have opportunity to rent a car, it will give us more comfort and flexibility. Even if we plan to walk all day, we can leave car in car park and come back at the end of the day. Every Monastery have few parking spaces, which might be occupied, but every viewpoint has bigger car park – which mean we would need to walk bit more to get to Monastery. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We can also buy guided tour, there are plenty of those available, from Athens, from Thessaloniki or from local bus stop in Kalambaka. That kind of activity will have limited time and we might not see all 6 Monasteries but will allowed also to local area and its perfect for someone who does not have ability to rent a car.
